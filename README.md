## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. **Install npm dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Project

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the project in your default web browser. The server usually runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) by default.

2. **Build the project for production:**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

   This creates an optimized production build of your application in the `build` directory.
